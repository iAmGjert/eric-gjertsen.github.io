/**FUNCTION
 * 
 * 0. the two phases to using functions: First we must____?
 * Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a function?)
 * a functino by?
 * 1. What's the difference between a function's parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
 * 2. What's the syntax for a NAMED function?
 * 3. How do we assign a function to a variable?
 * 4. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do
 * we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
 * 5. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in a parent or global scopes. The inverse
 * is NOT true.
 * 6. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and 
 * is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these 
 * closures!
